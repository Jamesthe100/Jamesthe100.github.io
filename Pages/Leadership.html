        <h1>How to lead any team to Win</h1>
        <p>By James Khuat</p>
        
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Hi, I am James.
            As an ambitious leader and student, I have ambitious
            goals in life, and I am sure you, reader, do too,
            I know that many people are attempting to organize their lives because they understand that the key to having a successful team is to organize your life. Throughout this article
            article I'll go over a few things that I believe are important to know before leading a team. </p>
        
        <h2>How to start a team</h2>
<p>Before we talk about how to lead a team, we need to talk about how to start a team.
    Leading people may be your main goal here, but first we have to start small. To begin your team, you should use your connections to recruit people.
    Just because that person is your friend does not mean they are suitable for the job. I know it might be fun, but sometimes it takes
    sacrifice to make a good team. Instead, try to find a suitable working partner among people you trust who have amibitious goals like you.
</p>

<h2>How to begin the journey</h2>
<p> Now that we have covered how to start a team, let's think about how to begin the long journey your team will go through.
    The first thing you want to do is plan out your journey, gather your team, and discuss your small goal to achieve the bigger one.
    organize out the roles and try to really understand your team's and your teammates full potential. Try to start with a small, simple task and work your way up.
</p>

<h1> Main Goal</h1>
<ul>
    <li> Understand your team potential</li>
    <li> Understand your teammates potential</li>
    <li> Plant out and let your teammate understand the big goal</li>
    <li> Have a suitable trusting working partner</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to lead</h2>
<p> Now that we have gone through the basics, let's talk about how to lead a team to succeed as a company or a team in sports to win.
    Since I am just a student, let's just talk about sports, though even these sports can be related to companies. To lead a team to victory, you first earn the member's trust and respect by being a leader.
    To do this, even if you are worse than others, try to set an example of you working hard every day and trying your best. Set a goal and always focus on the goal. This will make the member trust that you are a hard
    working leader who expects high expectations.</p>

<h2>How to manage the team</h2>
<p>Since we have been able to learn to begin, start, and lead a team, we should talk about managing a team. When you are able to manage and organize your team, you will be able to push your team to the maximum of their potential.
    As I have already said, try to let them trust you and give them chances. Be friendly and don't be bossy, let the team have a break and a chance after a while don't always push the team to the max. By doing this, your team knows how to lead the team, and you have already laid out the path.
    You will also really feel that there are open chances. Another thing is to set small goals along the way, set a goal each day with the team, and go on your way. Focus on three tasks each day and finish what's most important. </p>

<h2> Motivation you might need</h2>
<ul> 
    <li> If the plants wants to reach heven it's roots have to reach hell</li>
    <li> If a person stands behind you protect them, if they stand beside you respect them, if they stand against you show no mercy</li>
    <li> A strong man stands up for himself, a stronger man stands up for others</li>
    <li> 99% hardwork, 1% talent</li>
    <li> You are always to scared to start, because the first thing you see is bad things 10 miles ahead</li>
    <li> If you are going through hell then keep going</li>
    <li> A dumb person talk because they have to, a smart person talks because they have something to say</li>
    <li> I am not scared of no men, if they breath air it's fair game</li>
    <li> You either die a hero, are live long enough to see you become the vilian</li>
    <li> If you can't run, walk, if you can't walk, crawl, just keep moving</li>
    <li> It's not over until I win</li>
    <li> A boss, says I and points, a leader, say we and open a hand</li>
</ul>


    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p> Now, that's all of my advice, try to change what's really suitable for your team, after all, dreams come with passion. Thank you for reading, you are either younger than me or someone who has found a way to start early and begin your lifetime journey as a successful person.
