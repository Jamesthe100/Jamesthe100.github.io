            <h1>How to start the company </h1>
            <p>Starting a company can be simple, but it depends on your resources. When starting a company, try to hire a lot of people to expand the resources you work with. Make sure your company is futuristic and comfortable to work at.
                This will ensure the number of people wanting to go to the company because of its work space and futuristic plan. </p>
        
                <h1> How to get investment</h1>
        <p> Hiring people is important, but investing is more important. Try to invest using family members or friends, propose an idea to them and convince them.
            Don't use another company as the investor since the odds of you getting invested are even lower.
        </p>

        <h1> What to do?</h1>
        <p>Now that you know how to get investments and hire people, you don't know where to start. Of course, if you read my first page, it will help you.
            When you have the resources, gather everyone and try to assign jobs collaboratively. This is a simple task but can have a large impact on your company.
            After your company has a stable beginning, try to give it more growth, put more work in, and try to make a bigger task. This will let the employees improve and do more work.
            That's an important factor in starting a company since it can let you get more profit and have more variety just in case one crashes and burns.</p>

        <h1> Competition and how to deal with them</h1>
        <p> Getting a good product is already hard, but winning the fight is even harder. Imagine a road with six cars. Each car has different pros and cons. Some cars will die slowly, while others will take a different approach to the road. There is always a leader on the road, and there is always a crash.
            The best one you can use is to buy slower companies with fewer resources in order to have more resources for your company and chances. Also, try to use the main road at all times, because that's where most opportunities arise, and you'll be able to compete with larger companies.
            better chance of winning on the main road. Of course, it can be hard, but after getting the hang of it, there will be much more open space after the company takes different roads.
